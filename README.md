**current status: beta 1**

## Overview ##

IdentityManager is a modern replacement for the ASP.NET WebSite Administration tool that used to be built into Visual Studio. It is meant to be a tool for developers and/or administrators to manage the identity information for users of their applications. This includes creating users, editing user information (passwords, email, claims, etc.) and deleting users.
